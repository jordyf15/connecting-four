# Connecting Four
A mini project for The Odin project's Full Stack Ruby On Rails path Ruby Programming section where we have to build a connecting four game but with TDD where we create the test first and then the code.

## Live Demo on Repl
Live demo isn't available due to repl not being able to print the colored unicode symbol properly.   
To try the game please follow the below instruction on how to run it.
